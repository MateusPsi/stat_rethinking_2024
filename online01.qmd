"one of the things that has me confused is the difference between the posterior distribution and the posterior predicted distribution. I know that I need to do it and I can mechanistically write the code to get the right answer but I somehow don’t get the rationale for it."

Posterior predictive distributions are predictions of observable variables based on the posterior distribution. For instance: observations (data).

It's possible to do that with priors! Then check what it implies.

"So if I understand correctly, you use the posterior distribution, plug it back into the generative model, and the results of that are the posterior predicted distribution"

Likelihood vs Prior

Observada vs Não-observada.
